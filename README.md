My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/

All solutions written in C++, without using any external libraries. STL usage is limited to basic containers and algorithms.
Tasks and tests can be viewed on adventofcode website.

To build solutions use build.sh. It expects you to have clang++.
To run solutions use run.sh script. It expects you to put your own tests in 'tests' subfolder named like test{tasknum}_{testnum}.txt (e.g. test07_2.txt)

I might add comments to my code to explain the solutions when I feel like it.
